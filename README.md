# KendoTrainer
KendoTrainer readme
## Abstract
I want to make a program to help with kendo training, I want to code it in `Rust` and be compilable for multiple devices. For now the librem5 is my main target. But eventually I want to make one a lighter port for BBCMicro.

## Architecture

We will use the *view-model* as it is a tride and true way to make a GUI app.
